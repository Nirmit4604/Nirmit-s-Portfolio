							<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/Exam Front Page.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This image represents the header of a webpage I created for my final exam of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used HTML to structure the webpage, CSS to style its elements, and JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic features.

                                The header features a dark blue background with a snowy forest scene. The text "HTML, CSS, JS Fund. Final Exam" is displayed prominently on the image. The dark blue color symbolizes the foundation of web development, while the snowy forest scene represents the complexity and challenges of building a webpage. The text in white provides a clear and concise description of the purpose of the webpage, highlighting the core web development skills that were assessed in the exam.
                                
                                This image effectively showcases my ability to create visually appealing and informative web headers using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating my understanding of web design principles and programming concepts.</p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/Exam Last 2nd Page.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this project, I was tasked with arranging multiple images side by side with identical widths and heights, without any padding or margin. To achieve this, I utilized CSS to set the width and height of each image to the same value, and then used the display: inline-block property to align them horizontally. Additionally, I set the box-sizing property to border-box to ensure that the images' borders and padding were included in the width and height calculations, resulting in a seamless and cohesive layout. The final result was a visually appealing and responsive image gallery that showcased the images in a clean and modern way</p>

                            This project showcases my ability to design and develop a user-friendly form using HTML and CSS. The form is designed to collect user information, including email, password, and a binary choice (true or false). The form features a clear layout, visually appealing elements, and hidden password input for security. This project highlights my attention to detail, user experience design, and understanding of basic web development principles.

							<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/Products Page.PNG" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>I created a dynamic and engaging car company website with a product page. Users can easily browse through different car models, view their prices, and add them to their cart. The interactive hover effect adds a layer of engagement, enhancing the user experience</p>

                            <p>This contact form allows users to send a message to the car company. Users can enter their name and email address, and then send a message with any questions or inquiries they may have. The form also provides the company's address, phone number, and email address for additional contact options. This is a simple and effective way for the car company to collect customer data and provide excellent customer service</p>
